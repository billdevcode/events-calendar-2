# Events Calendar-2

This challenge is to build an events calendar site using React/Redux. A boilerplate was used as the initial setup so we have cool stuff like hot reloading and code splitting.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo - `git clone https://github.com/billdevcode/events-calendar-2.git`
2. Go into the folder - `cd events-calendar-2`
3. Install dependencies - `yarn install` or `npm install`
4. Start server - `yarn start` or `npm start`
5. Open a browser and go to http://localhost:3000

## Structure

- The **fun** stuff are all in `/src`
